This will be done eventually.  Anyways.

\section{Joining}
First, add the appropriate bot to your list.  If you're reading this you probably already got there.

To join the main lobby, send an \verb+\invite+ command.  If you are ever disconnected from the chat, invoking this command will bring you back to the same room.

To join a set-up game, just use \verb+\confirm+.

\section{Available Setups}
Invoke with \verb+\setup+.

\begin{itemize}
	\ii vanilla $m$ $n$
	\ii hmmt2013
	\ii troll3
	\ii skonly $n$
	\ii supersaint $m$ $n$
	\ii rps $n$
\end{itemize}

\section{Reporting Bugs}
Chat, online or offline, is preferable.  Otherwise email is OK too.
